## Project Overview

### Description:

The project aims to provide users with a convenient and efficient tool for recording and monitoring blood pressure measurements. It will provide a practical software application that allows individuals to track their readings over time, helping them maintain a record of their health and make informed decisions regarding their well-being, anytime or anywhere. 

###  Purpose:

The purpose of application is to assist users in managing their blood pressure and promoting healthier lifestyle choices. By providing an accessible and intuitive platform for recording and monitoring blood pressure measurements, it aims to assist users in promoting their cardiovascular health and fostering proactive management of their blood pressure. 

###  Objectives:

The primary objective is to design and create a user-friendly blood pressure monitoring application that is intuitive, visually appealing, and responsive across different devices. A functionality will be implemented that enables users to enter and store their measurements accurately. Mechanisms will be implemented to store & retrieve information via RESTful APIs. Visual representations will be provided, such as charts or graphs, to display measurements over time, helping user to track their progress effectively.

### Scope: 

This will be a Web app that will primarily focus on recording and managing systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements. A registration and authentication system will be implemented to ensure secure access to the app. User info and blood pressure measurements will be stored securely in a database. Visualizations, such as charts or graphs, will be implemented to display blood pressure measurements over time. It will be accessible and responsive across different platforms, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Implementing tracking from devices, e.g. via Bluetooth connectivity, in a web app can involve more complexity compared to native mobile or desktop applications, hence, it is determined that this feature will not be within the scope of this project.
